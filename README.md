## Features

- **Image Conversion**: Convert your original deep space images to black and white for better clarity and analysis.
- **Star Filtering**: Filter stars based on size (in pixels) and luminance values (brightness).
- **Star Labeling**: Label stars from the biggest (starting at 1) to the smallest.
- **Star Counting**: Get an accurate count of the number of stars in your image. The count updates in real-time as you apply different filters.
- **Star Highlighting**: Circle stars in the image for better visualization.

## How It Works

The core of the image conversion utilizes the Union-Find algorithm, ensuring efficient and accurate conversion of images to black and white.
